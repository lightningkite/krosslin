# Ideas

- KoolUI iOS
    - SVG support
    - Location support
- KoolUI/Kabinet File Handling`
    - `interface DataHandle`
        - `val type: MediaType`
        - `val probableSize: Long`
        - `suspend fun stream(range: LongRange): Input`
    - `RemoteBlob` containing HTTP request info is valid
    - `LocalBlob` containing stream is also valid, via the below
    - Database `tweak` can upload the file
    - Readable streams using KotlinX IO
    - Serialization for Stream
        - Serialize as UUID
        - Add to `@ThreadLocal` scoped serialization
        - Within scope you can retrieve by UUID
        - Send as part of the request
    - Deserialization for Stream
        - Gather UUIDs, placing in `@ThreadLocal` scoped deserialization
        - Return `Input` that reads UUID file in a temp directory
        - Inputs only available within scope, files deleted afterwards
- Upload files along with requests
    - Needs
    - Option: in request, multipart with name overrides special holder type 'file', which ends up as just a file reference in temp, maxing out at x size 
        - File reference directly?
        - URL: `temp://file.gif` - this might work really really well, but it's not explicit
        - `inline class FileReference(val path: String)`
            - Serialize
- Postgres Indexes and Better Migrations (?)
    - Auto-migrate?
        - Efficiency boost by doing same op on all objects if default value is constant
        - If default value is computed, we'll have to run it an object at a time.
        - Alternately, lazy compute it - make the queries compensate for it?
    - Manual migrations?
- Notifications
    - FCM on iOS
    - FCM on Web
- System Control
    - Issue tracking
    - Statistical tracking
    - Spinning up whole new apps using AWS (or other things?)
    - Server health checks, including 'overloaded' health checks
- SQLite (Android)
- SQLite (iOS)
- SQLite (JVM)
- IndexedDB (JS)
- Kommunicate
    - iOS Sockets
    - Simpler
    - Needs file handles
- Server Observables
    - Client can request updates
    - Client can receive updates
    - Client can stop receiving updates
    - Server can accept requests for updates
    - Server can send updates out to those listening (multiple servers)
    - Server can handle stopping updates
- KoolUI Lanterna Output
- KoolUI GTK+ Output
- Database Subgraph Retrieval
    - Request with reference paths to return
- REST Database Support
    - Server serving RESTful
    - Client reading RESTful
- GraphQL Database Support
    - Server serving GraphQL
    - Client reading GraphQL
- 'View' data classes for databases
    - Allow you to query and such with SQL's views as opposed to making a new table
    - Fixes DB normalization issues
- Reference-loop handling serializer
- Canvas for KoolUI
    - Single draw instruction at a time
        - matrix
        - move
        - line
        - curve
        - setPaint
        - clearRect
        - drawImage
        - text
- Synced Database
    - Takes local DB and remote DB, syncing them and using what's available so it works
- Part of database interface: `status()`, which returns the status of the DB with information like usage, capacity, etc
- View multiple parts of a view stack at the same time on larger devices
    - `data class ListPosition(val list: MutableList<T>, val index: Int)`
        - `popToThis()`
        - `pushFromThis()`
        - `popFromThis()`
- KoolUI OpenGL view

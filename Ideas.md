# Ideas

- Part of database interface: `status()`, which returns the status of the DB with information like usage, capacity, etc
- Observe over a network through web sockets
- Stackview on larger screens shows multiple
- KoolUI OpenGL view

Let's step back to actual use of databases.

Goals:
- Store a collection of objects
- Store quick, temporary settings - pairs, I suppose, requires PK to be changeable
- Transfer graphs of objects
- Semi-Partial queries

Database
- Put
- Query
- Delete
- Modify

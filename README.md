# Krosslin

A collection of libraries for Kotlin cross-platform development by [Lightning Kite](https://lightningkite.com)

This is the master repository for editing all of the libraries at once, keeping them in harmony and testing their synergy.

If you want to see an example of all of these working together, take a look at the test app in [koolui](https://github.com/lightningkite/koolui).

More documentation coming soon.
